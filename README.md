# Introduction
This is my final project for ECE 362: Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing
I attempted to write a complete tictactoe game with different game states and a scorekeeper with a reset button.

## Dev Board & Environment
- STM32F091 development board
- Eclipse IDE with the "System Workbench for STM32" plugin
- STLink Driver to interface with the STM32
- OpenSTM32 Standard Peripheral Library
